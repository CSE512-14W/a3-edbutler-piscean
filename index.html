      <p>Music consists of melody (typically, the words being sung) and chords (the guitar and/or keyboards playing in the background). As a song plays, the sequence of chords played is called its &ldquo;chord progression&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>This visualization shows the chord progressions for several popular songs on a chord diagram. For instance, If a song has a chord progression (in its verse, chorus, etc) that goes from the tonic (1 chord) to the dominant (5 chord), then there is an arc from the &ldquo;1&rdquo; group to the &ldquo;2&rdquo; group in the above diagram. The total number of such transitions is shown in the above diagram.</p>
